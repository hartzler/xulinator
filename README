Xulinator

A skeleton project for building xulrunner based RIA's using HTML5.  Views are constructed with HAML, logic with coffeescript, and css with less.  Default libs are jquery, knockoutjs, and twitter bootstrap.  Currently outputs an application directory tree on mac, and a simple tar.gz for linux (largely untested).

Dependencies

Currently depends on a bunch of junk to build / run.
- ruby
- rake
- haml
- less
- js (command line executable comes with the mac xulrunner-sdk but not linux)
- curl (to get the xulrunner-sdk)

Future:

Could be neat to make this into a set of scripts to better generate this stuff.  Probably talk more about security, as this is all up to the user at the moment.
